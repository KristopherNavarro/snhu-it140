Welcome! </p>
This repository is a general collection of all files related to my classwork for IT-140 Introduction to Scripting. 
Any files related to zyBooks prompts are appropriately named with corresponding section numbers, these can be found in the [zyBooks Labs](https://github.com/KristopherNavarro/snhu-it140/settings/branch_protection_rules/new?branch_name=main) directory.
All files pertaining to the final class project, Text Based Game, can be found in the Class Project directory.
This includes a Jupyter Notebook where I collected and tested ideas for the final project, as well as the final project files.

I welcome and encourage any feedback or questions, thank you!

Cheers, </p>
Kristopher Navarro
