# This LAB has 3 parts:
#
# (1) Prompt the user to enter two words and a number, storing each into separate variables.
# Then, output those three values on a single line separated by a space. (Submit for 1 point)
#
# Ex:   If the input is:    yellow
#                           Daisy
#                           6
#       the output after
#       the prompts is:    'You entered: yellow Daisy 6'
#                           Note: User input is not part of the program output.

input1_word   = input('Enter a word: ')             # Delete the input prompt string when submitting
input2_word   = input('Enter a second word: ')      # Delete the input prompt string when submitting
input3_number = input('Enter a number: ')           # Delete the input prompt string when submitting




# (2) Output two passwords using a combination of the user input. Format the passwords as shown below.
# (Submit for 2 points, so 3 points total).
#
# Ex:   If the input is:    yellow
#                           Daisy
#                           6
#       the output after
#       the prompts is:  '''You entered: yellow Daisy 6

# (3) Output the length of each password (the number of characters in the strings).
# (Submit for 2 points, so 5 points total).
