# 3.12 LAB: Seasons
# Write a program that takes a date as input and outputs
# the date's season. The input is a string to represent
# the month and an int to represent the day.
#
#   Ex:     If the input is:    April
#                               11
#           the output is:      Spring
#
# In addition, check if the string and int
# are valid (an actual month and day).
#
#   Ex:     If the input is:    Blue
#                               65
#           the output is:      Invalid
#
# The dates for each season are:
#   Spring:  March 20   -   June 20
#   Summer:  June 21    -   September 21
#   Autumn:  September 22 - December 20
#   Winter:  December 21 -  March 19
