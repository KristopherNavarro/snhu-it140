#  Write a program with total change amount as an integer input, and output
#  the change using the fewest coins, one coin type per line. The coin types
#  are Dollars, Quarters, Dimes, Nickels, and Pennies. Use singular and plural
#  coin names as appropriate, like 1 Penny vs. 2 Pennies.
#
#   Ex:     If the input is:    0 (or less than 0),
#           the output is:      No change
#
#   Ex:     If the input is:    45
#           the output is:      1 Quarter
#                               2 Dimes
