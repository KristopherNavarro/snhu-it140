# Write a program that replaces words in a sentence. The input begins with
# word replacement pairs (original and replacement). The next line of input
# is the sentence where any word on the original list is replaced.
#
# Ex:   If the input is:    automobile car   manufacturer maker   children kids
#                               The automobile manufacturer recommends car seats for children
#                               if the automobile doesn't already have one.
#       the output is:      The car maker recommends car seats for kids if the car doesn't already have one.
#
# You can assume the original words are unique.
